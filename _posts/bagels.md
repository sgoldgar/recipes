## Ingredients: 
- 4 1/4 cups AP flour (or a mix of bread flour and AP)
- 2 (.25 oz) active dry yeast
- 1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees)
- 4 tablespoons of white sugar (or barley malt syrup)
- 1 tablespoon salt


## Insructions:

1. Combine *1 1/2 cups* flour and yeast in a large bowl. 
2. Mix water, 3 tablespoons sugar, and salt together; add to dry ingredients. 
3. Beat with a mixer for half a minute at low speed, scraping the sides of the bowl clean. Beat at a higher speed for 3 minutes. Then mix in enough flour by hand to make a moderately stiff dough.
4. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. 
5. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes.
6. Cut into 12 portions and shape into smooth balls. Poke a hole in the center with your finger, and gently enlarge the hole while working the bagel into a uniform shape. Cover and let rise for 20 minutes.
7. Meanwhile, start a gallon of water boiling. Add in remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and mix it around a bit. Reduce to simmering.
8. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
9. When bagels have risen, put 4 or 5 bagels into the water and cook for 7 minutes, turning once. Drain.
10. Add toppings once cooked
11. Place drained bagels on a greased baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes.
