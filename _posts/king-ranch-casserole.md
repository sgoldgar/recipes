## Ingredients: 
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 1 yellow onion, chopped
- 1 red bell pepper, chopped
- 8 ounces button mushrooms, sliced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon chili powder
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 3 1/2 cups chicken stock
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1 small can of chiles in adobo
- 1 ten-ounce can Ro-Tel
- 18 corn tortillas
- 1 cooked chicken (poached or roasted), meat shredded
- 1 cup shredded Jack cheese
- 1 cup shredded cheddar



## Insructions:

1. Melt the butter in a large sauté pan over medium heat. 
2. Add the vegetables and sauté on medium-low about 7 minutes. 
3. Stir in the chili powder, cayenne, salt, and pepper and cook for 1 minute. 
4. Sprinkle in flour, 1/2 cup at a time, and stir until the white is no longer visible. 
5. Whisk in 3 cups of the stock, 1 cup at a time, until smooth. Whisk in cream and stir in chiles and tomatoes.

6. Preheat the oven to 350. 
7. Grease a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with butter. Pour remaining 1/2 cup of stock into a bowl. 
8. Stack the tortillas in the bowl, 6 at a time, to moisten, then line the bottom of the pan with the tortillas, making sure they overlap each other by about one third. Cover the tortillas with half the sauce. Add half the chicken and sprinkle with a third of the cheese. Add a second layer of soaked tortillas, the remaining sauce and chicken, and another third of the cheese. Top with the remaining tortillas and cheese.

9. Bake for about an hour, until bubbling and lightly browned on top. Remove from the oven and let sit for 10 minutes before serving.
