## Ingredients: 
- 1 3/4 cups (8oz) AP flour
- 1/4 cup of sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 4 tablespoons cold salted butter, cut into pieces
- 1/3 cup currants
- 1/2 cup whole milk
- 1 large egg
- 1 large egg, beaten for brushing over tops

## Insructions:

1. Heat oven to 425Â° F.
2. Sift together flour, 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder and salt into large bowl. 
3. Using fingertips or pastry blender, rub or cut the Kerrygold Salted Butter into flour mixture to form coarse crumbs. 
4. Add raisins. Whisk together milk and 1 egg. 
5. Make a well in the flour mixture; pour in milk mixture. 
6. Using fork, stir just until soft, moist dough is formed.
7. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface; gently knead 1 or 2 times to incorporate loose pieces of dough. (Do not over knead.) 
8. Pat dough to 1 1/2-inch thickness. Using well-floured 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter or bottom of a glass, cut out about 6 rounds, recombining scraps as necessary. Place rounds on lightly buttered baking sheet. 
9. Brush tops with additional beaten egg; sprinkle with additional sugar.
10. Bake until golden brown, about 14 to 17 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking for more even browning. 

NOTE: These scones are more muffin-like in texture; dough will be moist and wet, which ensures a tender texture.
